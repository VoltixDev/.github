## Who we are
We are Voltix, a bot development group based in the Netherlands.  
Our mission is to make affordable bots, of great quality available to everyone.

All our bots are open-source, with a CC BY-NC-ND license, to promote security.

## Why us
### Security
As mentioned earlier, all our bots are open source, which means anyone can look if the bot is safe.
Additionally, all bots are hosted on our server in Germany, which means all your data is protected by the EU.
Any sensitive data like e-mail addresses, password, etc. are stored with military-grade encryption.

### Experience
All our developers are experienced in multiple languages, and in developing bots.
We only accept the highest standard of developers, and exclusively use top-tier libaries.

## How we operate
### Libraries
Depending on who is assisting you with your bot, expect your bot to be programmed in one of the following:
- [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org)
- [Discord.NET](https://discordnet.dev)
- [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io)

### Data storage
We maintain high data safety standards, and as such we use [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), the global standard.
Data is usually stored in either JSON or MySQL, depending on who is assisting you.
